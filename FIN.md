Processes are the building blocks for major Elixir language
abstractions such as:

- Agents
- Tasks
- GenServer
- GenStage

While other languages would require us to catch/handle 
exceptions, in Elixir we are actually fine with 
letting processes fail because we expect supervisors 
to properly restart our systems. “Failing fast” is a 
common philosophy when writing Elixir software!
